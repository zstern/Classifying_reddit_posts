465,Doesn't Queen Elsa from Frozen Understand that Tariffs her people?," 

So, I've had some trouble figuring out the geopolitical and governmental structure of Arendellian society, as it seems to make very little sense as it relates to its existence as a kingdom (or, rather, seeing as it takes place in 19th century Europe, a Post-Westphalian nation-state)

To start. What gives Elsa the authority to arbitrarily go all mercantilist on the Duke of Wesselton by stifling both him and his state with tariffs at the end of the movie? It's strange. Doesn't she know that she's just hurting her own people enacting protectionist policies? Most imperial-era royals were well-educated, even the girls, so I'm sure she would at least have a basic foundation in economics. Especially if she were to be queen one day, and the queen had the direct authority to dictate trade policy instead of having the legislatures take care of it.

Elsa would have put tariffs on him, because that was their way of essentially preventing trade with other countries. Unless Arendelle is a total command economy &amp; the State owned the markets &amp; ships. But it hardly seems like the type of place that would outright nationalize the economy. Maybe a bit of central planning, sure, but more in the mercantilist/corporatist/economic nationalist sense. Essentially, in a pre-capitalist mercantilist economy, tariffs were how you cut off trade, since it was far easier than placing outright sanctions on another country. Essentially, it was pretty coercive, since the tariffs would be SO high that, if anyone were to trade with them, that person would practically lose money. Plus, the tariffs would probably be accompanied by an embargo on luxury items as well.

Frozen is my favorite Disney movie (and ever since I saw it at the theatre back when I was in my late teens, Elsa has been my cartoon crush), but there are a lot of things that don't make sense, particularly as it relates to Arendelle itself. The city appears to be rather small - the kind of place you'd imagine a Duke to live rather than a monarch. Plus, it seems relatively demilitarized...to the point that the king and queen don't have a retinue of guards. What if highwaymen were to ambush them all on their way to see the rock trolls? Who's next in line? Would that trigger the War of the Arendellean Succession? Also, despite Anna being a royal and all, what gives her the legitimacy to arbitrarily put Prince Hans in charge? He's a foreigner. That'd be like if Trump went on vacation to New Brunswick and put Nigel Farange in charge. Wouldn't there be an acting regent to take command, by law? Even in absolute monarchies, there were rules, as dictated by the Divine Right of Kings. And about the legitimacy of Elsa's rule (going back to the tariff thing), but it does not make sense that she could be able to make that kind of decree. So, while I assume Elsa and the people of Arendelle are religious, I highly doubt that they would follow the Divine Right of Kings.

Seeing as Frozen is probably set among the backdrop of the Napoleonic Wars, or shortly after Waterloo, that would make Arendelle a nation-state, due to international law set forth by the Treaty of Westphalia in the 1640s. Nationalism &amp; the new concept of sovereignty became a key factor in the development and self-determination of most every European nation-state, most of which were monarchies. By the 19th century, there was practically no such thing as an absolute monarchy. With that assumption, I'd imagine that Arendelle is a constitutional-monarchy. That being said, it wouldn't be up to Elsa to put restrictions on Wesselton - that power would derive from the parliament or legislative assembly. Elsa seems intelligent, so I'd suspect she has at least heard of John Locke before, and the other great philosophers of the liberal tradition.

It's possible Arendelle could be a vassal state or a client of some other kingdom or hegemon - perhaps of the Tangled kingdom - but that would make Elsa more of a ceremonial satrap than anything else, and she seems to have legitimate political power. Though the succession laws make little sense - why did Elsa have to wait until she was twenty before she got crowned? Generally succession occurs right away, for ceremonial purposes, and a right-regent would run things until he or she came of age. Who was the regent of Arendelle?

And where's its military? I swear, it's ripe for conquest. The Danish probably have their sights on it. Prince Eric from the Little Mermaid is dangerous. He seems like he'd grow into a war mongerer (although my head canon is that he's one of Hans' older brothers). It just seems out of whack politically and geopolitically. And on another note: Arendelle seems to have a very strong economy, despite being so seemingly small. As such, it would not be thriving nearly as well at that size were it mercantilist or nationalist. As such, Elsa would be making a major mistake, and it would hurt the economy, even if Arendelle's joint stock companies would profit. But the people wouldn't under such a system. Besides, this was the 1800s for crying out loud. By that time, ""the Wealth of Nations"" had completely transformed the way just about everything that people once thought about basic economics. So unless Elsa didn't get the memo, it would most likely not be run that way.

Arendelle and Wesselton seemed to have pretty close economic ties, and I will assume that the other dignitaries represented close trading partners with Arendelle as well. Because it was, in fact, trading openly with other nations freely, it seems safe to say that Arendelle engaged in free trade, and, given the era, laissez-faire capitalism. I'd say Arendelle is a few decades away from becoming truly industrialized.

Still, there's something weird about Arendelle. Elsa really needs new economic advisors. If John Stuart Mill weren't still in his teens at this point, I'd recommend him. Maybe Bastiat could do. My first choices would be Friedman or Hayek, but this is a bit too early for that.

Still, Arendelle needs some work...﻿",Showerthoughts,1544676354,MisterCharlton,1,1,True,2018-12-12

124,The Catcher in the Rye reads a lot like Donald Trump speaks.,"Was looking up literary quotes for a different subreddit and came across this paragraph from The Catcher in the Rye:

*The thing was, I couldn't think of a room or a house or anything to describe the way Stradlater said he had to have. I'm not too crazy about describing rooms and houses anyway. So what I did, I wrote about my brother Allie's baseball mitt. It was a very descriptive subject. It really was. My brother Allie had this left-handed fielder's mitt. He was left-handed. The thing that was descriptive about it, though, was that he had poems written all over the fingers and the pocket and everywhere. In green ink. He wrote them on it so that he'd have something to read when he was in the field and nobody was up at bat. He's dead now. He got leukemia and died when we were up in Maine, on July 18, 1946. You'd have liked him. He was two years younger than I was, but he was about fifty times as intelligent. He was terrifically intelligent. His teachers were always writing letters to my mother, telling her what a pleasure it was having a boy like Allie in their class. And they weren't just shooting the crap. They really meant it. But it wasn't just that he was the most intelligent member in the family. He was also the nicest, in lots of ways. He never got mad at anybody. \[…\] God, he was a nice kid, though. He used to laugh so hard at something he thought of at the dinner table that he just about fell off his chair.*

I first read the book before Trump was elected and reading it again I notice a lot of the phrases (""It was a very descriptive subject. It really was... You'd have liked him... He was terrifically intelligent.... They really meant it."") sound a lot like the way DJT speaks. Just thought it was interesting/spooky.

there was so much hype for red dead 2. many put it down, including me, saying that there could never be a replacement for the single character story as compelling as johns..

suffice to say, rdr2 lived up to the hype. the dedicated team behind it produced perhaps the greatest single player game (in my opinion) continuation of all time. it brought chills. it was filled with *hours* of exploration. it made me want to play the game over again. it brought me back to the feelings i had with rdr1.

Just like MJ and Lebron.

People thought of MJ as the greatest. and we saw the same thing happen through lebron. the hype produced. many people doubted. many people were like nah he aint anything.. but he produced once in a generation like talent. i dont see anyone even near to his hype.

257,Fear is NOT Always the Enemy,"I'm sitting across from a middle aged woman in a bar. Her hair is blond, she is sipping rum. To my left is a man; he is around my age at the time;probably between 23 and 25 years old. Copious amounts of liquor are flooding my blood stream; I'm angry. The man to my right is making inappropriate comments concerning the woman we're both interacting with. Sarcastically he says ""you don't have a chance with her"" spitting the words like arsenic in my direction. At this point I'm in and out of consciousness; people call it a ""brown-out"", where you're somewhat aware of what's going on., but not entirely. I'm not innocent in this scenario. My words are egotistical and arrogant. Soon my anger boils over and I stand up. I tell the man whom I'm sitting with to ""Fuck Off"" and I walk into the blackness of the night, heading towards my room. I'm staggering, and stumbling; a mess of a human. In and out, in and out of cognisance. I turn left on the path, there is a large hedge towering over the path in front of me. Suddenly, I hear a pitter patter of footsteps; somethings not right. In an instant I absorb the force of a fist on the back of my skull, then another on my ear, followed by one to the eye and I'm brought to my knees. In desperation and shock I say in a perfunctory sort of manner ""alright that's enough!"" before being knocked out by a final blow. The bottom of the hedge becomes a resting place for my head. A while passes, I'm not sure how long before I wake. Covered in blood and confusion my eyelids break the crust that seals them shut and I scan the area and the length of my body. My watch; gone, my shoes; gone, my dignity; gone. And I walk back to my room in a stupor, not knowing if it was the man at the bar who attacked me and perhaps one of his friends who was not sitting with us, or was it someone else? I never found out.
          There are things about me you may not know. I'm a recovering alcoholic, almost 4 years clean and sober at this point. During this episode in Cuba I was around 24 years old. Desperately trying to deal with an unsettled, discontented, frightened mind through an overindulgence with alcohol. How do I escape myself? How do I feel comfortable in my own skin? My main coping strategy was alcohol at the time. It's all I knew; It's all I lived for really. I wanted to bi-pass fear. FEAR. The omnipotent ""useless"" feeling that I frantically tried to escape. However; fear is not useless. It's actually a key component to our survival on this earth. We don't usually need fear in the primal, primitive way it used to be needed when we all hung out in caves, but sometimes; as highlighted in this situation, we do. A sober me would never have been hanging out in a bar at 3 in the morning with two random people who were obviously (like me) not in the greatest place physically or mentally. Fear would have told me not to use such volatile words. There wouldn't have been a solo walk back to my place at 3am, and thus, I would not have been jumped. 
       Many of us don't experience such violent incidences because we choose to listen to the voice of reason in our heads that tells us not to walk down that alley at night, or not to associate with those particular people. This is where that primal instinct becomes HIGHLY useful. So, today I'm going to be thankful for fear, and for the fact that I'm mentally able to access and evaluate that feeling with awareness and good-judgement. There are times when fear isn't so helpful, but we won't get into that today. Thank you FEAR for saving my big plump, juicy rump.
 
       ""Fear can be a liar, and more often than not it's our greatest obstacle when we're trying to achieve something fantastical, however; never willingly remain ignorant towards fear, it is there for a reason.""

91,All theories regaurding that which is right or wrong attempt to find truth where it doesn't exist.,"There's no such thing as good or bad on a universal scale.
There is such a thing on an individual scale, in the form of an 'opinion'.
When an certain opinion is agreed upon by many individuals, groups or communities are often made to preach their ideals as truth. Basically they're saying that their ideas are better than yours. 
When the opinions of individuals within a society begin to diverge. 
Societies are an attempt to create an individual out of individuals. Unless every individual within a society is exactly the same or actually somehow all believe the exact same things, this is impossible. And even then, whether or not said superindividual's opinions are right or wrong isn't really an applicable question. 

I do understand that this may seem hypocritical (a belief about how all beliefs are wrong, yes I see it), and I'll reply to that by first saying that I'm not saying that they're wrong, I'm just saying you can't classify it as write or wrong. And then I'll continue to reply by classifying my belief as an opinion that cannot be classified as true or untrue due to its status as an opinion.
